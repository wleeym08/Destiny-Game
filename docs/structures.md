# Data Structure

A stack and queue is used in this program.

## Stack

A stack-like structure is needed to keep track of the steps of the character in game in order to achieve feature like undoing the moves. Also, it can be used for the DFS (depth first search) algorithm to find the least steps to move to the goal safely.

## Queue

A queue-like structure is required for the BFS (breadth first search) algorithm to find the shortest path to move to the goal safely.
