# OpenGL Introduction

## What is OpenGL?

**OpenGL** is a low-level API for advanced computer graphics. It's widely used in the industry. The other API that is similar to OpenGL is **DirectX**. Nowadays most of the development (let's say game development) may use higher level libraries but that doesn't mean OpenGL is useless. Instead, it's still powerful and it's being wrapped into engines like **Unity** for user's convenience.

OpenGL is important for the operating system as well. Usually, the support for OpenGL is installed together with the OS. On Windows, you'll find a DLL called `opengl32.dll` in your `system32` folder. On MacOS and Linux, the implementation may be different but it is still one of the essential component. But in order to develop programs using OpenGL, we'll need more than that.
